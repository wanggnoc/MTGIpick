MTGIpick - A software developed intending to identify Genomic Islands
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is MTGIpick?

MTGIpick implements a multiscale statistical algorithm to predict genomic islands from a single genome. It uses a small-scale test with large-scale features to score small region deviating from the host and a large-scale statistical test with small-scale features to identify multi-window segments for identification of genomic islands. MTGIpick can identify genomic islands from a single genome, without annotated information of genomes or prior knowledge from other datasets. 

2. Requirements

MTGIpick has been compiled and tested under Sun Java interpretera and Matlab. MTGIpick can be used in Windows-, Linux- and Mac-based platforms. Java Virtual Machine and MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) are required for MTGIpick setup on your platform. However, we strongly advise the use of openjdk (JDK) instead of the Oracle version of java virtual machine when working in linux-based or Mac-based machines as the Oracle version may result in some exceptions during the analyses.
